I was trying to implement remember me option with rest api.

My conclusion is that for rest api is better a JWT token authentication
with a refresh token option as remember me.

If I have a web app with thymeleaf and something like spring session, 
remember me option can be a solution. 

So, this practice is in stand by for the moment, I don't want to do
a jsp page with thymeleaf now.
